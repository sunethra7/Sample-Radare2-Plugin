A Sample Command Plugin for Radare2

Scott Dunlop <swdunlop@gmail.com>


This is a skeletal sample for writing a Radare2 command plugin in C; this is not the most accessible way to add a command to Radare2, and also not the correct way to write a general purpose plugin, but it was the most direct way for me to patch in a few fixes for end-user stupidity.

Much thanks to pancake and everyone involved in the r2 project -- it's nice to escape GDB for a while..
